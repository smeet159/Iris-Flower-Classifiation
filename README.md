# Iris-Flower-Classifiation


		
Here the aim is to classify iris flowers among three species (Iris-Setosa, Iris-versicolor or Iris-virginica) from measurements of length and width of sepals and petals.

The iris data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant.

The central goal here is to design a model which makes good classifications for new data, in other words one which exhibits good generalization.The file iris_train.csv contains the Iris dataset in comma sepparated values (CSV) format.

The models used are: 1) Support vector machines
		     2) Linear regression
		     3) K nearest neighbours
		      

I've created three models and compared the efficiency among them to decide which one is better for this dataset.
