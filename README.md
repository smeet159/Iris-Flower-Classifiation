# Iris-Flower-Classifiation


		
Here the aim is to classify iris flowers among three species (Iris-Setosa, Iris-versicolor or Iris-virginica) from measurements of length and width of sepals and petals.

The iris data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant.

The central goal here is to design a model which makes good classifications for new data, in other words one which exhibits good generalization.The file iris_train.csv contains the data for this example in comma sepparated values (CSV) format.
